# Simple Babylone In Prolog.

## Rules (from Bruno Faidutti Website):

### Components

12 sculptured stone pieces (3 Green, 3 Black, 3 Red, 3 Beige)
1 set of game rules

### Aim of the game

To be the first player to block the opponent.

### Game set up

The 12 pieces are placed randomly, one by one, between the two players.
There are then 12 piles 1 piece high, in 4 different colours.

### The game itself

Players play on turn. The youngest player chooses to play first or second.

He takes a pile and places it on top of another pile which has at least one common characteristic with the pile he moves :
- Either the height, (same number of pieces) ;
- Or the colour of the piece on top.

Height, 1 pile which contains 1 piece can be only put on a pile containing 1 piece, 1 pile which contains 2 pieces can be only put on a pile containing 2 pieces…..

Colour, only the colour of the piece located on top of each pile is taken into account.

Existing piles cannot be divided, which means that only all the pieces in a pile can be moved.

Once the player who went first has played, it is the opponent’s turn. He/she proceeds as indicated above and the game continues until one of the two players can no longer move a pile.

### End of the game

The game ends when one of the players cannot move anymore piles: He has lost and the other player wins the game.
